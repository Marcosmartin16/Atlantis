        Among the extraordinary Mexican fauna there is an amazing species, the Mexican axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum).
        It has an unusual physical appearance, it\'s the possessor of extraordinary faculties:
        It has the exceptional capacity to regenerate lost organs,
        and even part of the brain!… and the heart! \n \n

        The native and endemic axolotl (lives only) of the lakes of the Valley of Mexico and survives in Lake Xochimilco,
        It was called by the ancient Mexicans axolotl (from Nahuatl, "water monster") and retains ancient characteristics of
        salamanders, but is closer to frogs and toads.\n \n

        However, it seems to have forgotten his ability to move on land, because although he has four legs that
        allow him walking, in addition to a tail that it retains after metamorphosis (transformation),
        it only rises to the surface of the lake to breathe and immediately submerges.\n \n

        Black or mottled brown, albino or white, the Mexican axolotl retains its tadpole dorsal fin that extends almost
        throughout its entire body, which measures from 15 to 30 centimeters in length, and its external gills are
        shaped like feathers protrude from the back of its broad head.\n \n

        This axolotl feeds on molluscs, worms, larvae, crustaceans and the occasional fish, but it has not been able to
        get rid of the herons (type of bird) that engulf him and even less of its main predator, the human,
        who has also introduced large fish to Lake Xochimilco and its channels that threaten its survival.\n \n

        From before the Colony to the present, the axolotl has been a highly appreciated food for its flavor and
        nutritional properties, the same prepared in tamales as in soups and stews, that used in traditional medicine
        in formulas of syrup, ointment or infusions, against respiratory ailments.\n \n

        So many virtues made this unique creature was taken to the danger of extinction, because most citizens
        ignore that the repopulation of the Mexican axolotl is necessary,
        the same as stopping the degradation of its lacustrine habitat (lake where it lives).

        Seahorses attract attention. Its horse appearance in the body of a fish is the origin of its name.
        Thousands of euros can be paid for the most showy species and in some parts of the planet they are in
        danger for its medicinal uses in some countries. In the south of Portugal, the world\'s largest population, was
        located of seahorses. In a very small space, 600,000 specimens of two species lived, now there are only 155,000 left.
        They are now in danger of extinction. \n \n

        Seahorses are fish. However, they are different from other fish, as they have a flexible neck,
        a snout and a nimble tail. They can move each eye independently. The seahorse\'s tail is
        organized in square prisms, surrounded by bony plates.
        They use their tails as anchors.
        Its shape resists damage better and has a better grip than if it were circular.
        They usually live between 4 to 6 years. They live among corals, macroalgae, phanerogams (seed plants)
        marine and mangroves.\n \n

        They have no teeth or stomachs. They suck their prey whole up to 3 cm away.
        Because they lack stomachs, seahorses have to eat most of the time because of the rapid process of
        digestion. And as quickly as it eats, it defecates. They feed on small crustaceans, invertebrates and fishe\'s larvae.
        And its main food in the aquarium is Artemia, a small crustacean.
        A seahorse can eat 3,000 brine shrimp a day. \n\n

        Some seahorses are capable of changing color to blend in with their surroundings.
        The seahorses\' best defense against predators is camouflage.
        The males often fight each other with their tails during the mating season.
        The females also fight with each other or with other males, fighting for territory or food. \n \n

        In pairs, seahorses swim together holding on to each other\'s tails.
        Before mating, they perform a dance that culminates in the fertilization of the female\'s oocytes and the
        which the male shelters in the ventral area. They will stay there until the little ones are ready to leave.
        Then come the muscular contractions and the expulsion of their little ones.
        A male horse has to go through 45 days of pregnancy and can have 1,500 or even 1,800 offspring.
        Very few larvae reach the adult stage (1%). \n\n

        There are about 50 different species of seahorses.
        The smallest species is Hippocampus japapigu, this species is about 15 millimeters long.
        The largest species is Hippocampus ingens. Males can be 30 centimeters long.

        It is a decapod crustacean (it has 10 legs). It lives on rocky bottoms that are not too deep and usually less than
        100 m. hidden among the rocks. It can rarely be found on rocky bottoms (which have many stones).
        They are related to river crabs. They weigh between 700 grams and 7 kilos and their dimension can be between 25 and
        50 cm. \n \n

        Despite its heavy appearance, it is able to swim thanks to the powerful contractions of its heavily muscled tail.
        This is the part that makes it highly appreciated gastronomically. \n

        Of nocturnal habits, the lobster is very voracious and feeds on everything it finds, although its preferences are
        focus on polychaetes (worms), crustaceans, molluscs, algae, organic debris and worms. It highlights the fact that it is
        capable of breaking the hard shells of bivalves, despite lacking tweezers. \n \n

        According to the Book of Records, the largest lobster was caught in Nova Scotia (Canada), weighing 20.14 kg. \n
        When the lobster grows, it must shed the hard calcified shell that covers it (this operation is carried out several
        times throughout his life). It is precisely when it sheds its old armor that the animal is very vulnerable,
        since the new shell does not harden until after a few hours. This exoskeleton is often eaten by
        lobster to replenish the body\'s calcium reserves. \n \n

        The locust uses its long antennae to drive away its enemies, putting them between itself and the intruder.
        He also uses them to learn his immediate surroundings through touch, a necessary skill in low-light conditions.
        lighting typical of the cracks and holes in which you live. \n \n

        During their migration or journey, the locusts form a line touching the tail of the locust with their antennae.
        in front. Lobsters can form rows of up to 100,000 individuals, the row has the appearance of an eel
        or gigantic snake. If a daring animal tries to attack them, the locusts form a circle with their tails facing
        the center and all its spines out. \n \n

    <string name="historia_lobo">
        The appearance of this species varies more than that of any other family with age and sex.
        Adult males have a very long neck covered with thick and thick fur in relation to the rest of the body.
        Its snout is short and raised, adorned with long whiskers. \n \n

        The total length of the animal can reach up to 3.50 meters. The females do not exceed 2.50 meters,
        their forms are slim and elegant, the neck does not acquire the same thickness as that of the males and they lack a mane. \n \n

        The cubs, at birth, measure just over 40 cm. and are covered in short, healthy-looking hair that is almost black in color.\n \n

        Sea lions spend almost all their time in the sea. They are very skilled in the water, when they come out on land,
        look for the loneliest rocks or islets and walk with the body raised on the 4 limbs,
        with clumsy movements, but quite fast. Their food consists exclusively of fish.
        They devour between 15 and 25 kg per day. \n \n

        When spring arrives they begin to gather in the sea lion colonies; males arrive first
        They spend almost the whole day on land and soon after the females arrive to give birth.
        For a period of about 5 weeks these animals do not go to the water and therefore do not eat.
        The males form their harems, fighting with each other to see which can bring together the largest number of females.
        Everything is a continuous movement and it is also the moment where the killer whales approach to obtain their precious prey,
        pup wolves…
